=====================================
 NOTES FOR THE src/main/resources DIR
=====================================

This directory holds non-code assets and configuration files that the application needs at runtime.
When the project is built, these resources are packaged into the final JAR and made available on the classpath.

Common Uses:
------------
1. Configuration Files:
   - application.properties or application.yml
   - Database connection settings
   - Custom configuration files for libraries or frameworks

2. Logging Configuration:
   - logback.xml or similar config files for logging frameworks

3. Localization (i18n):
   - Messages.properties or other resource bundle files for different languages

4. Static Data and Assets:
   - JSON, XML, or TXT files that your application reads as input
   - Template files (such as HTML, Velocity, Freemarker, or Thymeleaf templates)
   - Images or icons, if needed

5. Documentation or Metadata:
   - Files explaining configuration settings
   - Schema definitions or sample data files

Tips:
-----
- Keep resource filenames and directories organized by purpose.
- Avoid placing large binary files here if possible.
- Consider creating subdirectories (e.g., `db/`, `config/`, `templates/`) to keep files organized.
- If you add a configuration file, consider adding comments to guide users on how to change settings or where to find documentation.

This NOTES.txt file is here as a reminder and a guide. Feel free to remove or update it as the project evolves.
